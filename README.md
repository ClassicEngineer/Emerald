## Idea
The idea of project is to create Obsidian-like note system (second-brain) by erasing border between .html and .md formats.
In other words, I want to create my notes that look great both in txt editor and modern web browser.
The idea is as classic as world being. There are thousand solutions over it, but I want to create my own. 

God, help me, please.

## Main Aim
Chill, Joy, Relax. We all know that creating alone such global and holywar things is very complex. So main aim is relax by coding, and nothing else.

## S.A.Q (seldomly asked questions)

### what is .u format ? 

u stands for universal. Yet another one Human-readable format. It will be my own format of files with kinda-new(ha-ha) semantic. Is is like child class that inherits parent basics from xml json and md.
The additional aim is to create converters: json->u->json, xml->u->xml, md->u->md and the main line: html->u->html.
